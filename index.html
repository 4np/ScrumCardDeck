        <p>
            Scrum Card Deck is a digital version of Scrum Poker / Planning Poker: a consensus-based technique for estimating and sizing user stories in agile software development. In particular together with the Scrum and Extreme Programming methodologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            During sprint planning in Scrum, the team can use these poker cards as a unit of measure for estimating the overall size of a user story, feature, or even associated piece of work. This tool helps the team assign points, in a relaxed manner, to stories or tasks. Having points assigned to every story will, in turn, help the team estimate how long it will take to complete each task, what story can be triangulated, and what goes into the next iteration. This tool is a consensus-based technique for estimating and coming to agreement on the projected workload in a sprint backlog.

        <h3><a name="gestures" class="anchor" href="#gestures"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gestures</h3>

        <p>
            While in card view (pictured above), a number of gestures are supported:
            <li class="swipe right">
                <div class="title">swipe right <i>from the left edge of the screen</i></div>
                <div class="details">
                    Swiping from the left edge of the screen to the right will make you go back
                    to the previous screen (the card list or card picker).
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="swipe left">
                <div class="title">swipe left <i>on the card</i></div>
                <div class="details">
                    Swiping from right to left on the card itself will flip the card over, similar to
                    a <i>single tap</i>. This is useful as in Scrum Poker you generally need to flip
                    the card over all at once.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="swipe up">
                <div class="title">swipe up <i>on the card</i></div>
                <div class="details">
                    Swiping up on the card will flip the card to the <i>next</i> card in the deck.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="swipe down">
                <div class="title">swipe down <i>on the card</i></div>
                <div class="details">
                    Swiping down on the card will flip the card to the <i>previous</i> card in the deck.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="swipe tap">
                <div class="title">single tap <i>on the card</i></div>
                <div class="details">
                    A single tap on the card itself will flip the card over, similar to a <i>left swipe</i>.
                    This is useful as in Scrum Poker you generally need to flip the card over all at once.
                </div>
            </li>

        <h3><a name="metrics" class="anchor" href="#metrics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Metrics and Privacy</h3>
        <p>
            In additional to several UI improvements metrics have been added to the 1.1 version. Anonymous information
            is gathered on the background to determine what the preffered deck view is (list or pick), how often
            someone ends up in the help view (to determine if the gestures in the card view need to be improved)
            and how swipe gestures are being used. This information is cumulatively and can <i>not</i> be used to
            identify the application of the user. This information will <i>only</i> be used to improve the application.
        </p>
